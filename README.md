# CEBRA -- Figures and Demos for paper

Code and data for reproducing the figures in
[Learnable latent embeddings for joint behavioral and neural analysis (Schneider, Lee and Mathis, 2022)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.00673).

This repo only contains plotting functions which can be applied to pre-computed results. Code for reproducing experiments and applying CEBRA
to custom datasets will be available in the [CEBRA github repository](https://github.com/AdaptiveMotorControlLab/CEBRA).

## Repo organization

- ``figures``: Jupyter notebooks for reproducing the paper figures
